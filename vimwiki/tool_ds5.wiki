*How it Works*
{{{

The gator driver is a dynamic module that the gator daemon inserts into the Linux/Android kernel when the daemon is launched. 
It performs tasks such as interrupting the processor at periodic intervals, walking the stack, and collecting performance metrics. 
For the gator driver to collect this information, the Linux kernel must be configured to make this  information available. 
The daemon reads the data collected by the driver, processes it into the .apc format, then transfers it to analysis engine of Streamline. 
Streamline processes the data into an .apd report for viewing.

Tou must have a kernel with the proper configuration and the gator daemon and driver running on the target. The remainder of this article describes how to do this.
}}}
*Preparing and Building the Kernel*
{{{

Assuming that you have an appropriate cross compilation environment is available, you must download the required version of the Linux kernel, 
configure it to your target platform, customize it, and then build it. Suppose you are at one of the B2G project root directory, For example: 
//Android 4.2 and lower, as blew:
export CROSS_COMPILE=./prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-
export ARCH=arm
cd kernel
make <platform_defconfig>  #e.g. sp8810ea-vlx_defconfig or sp8810ea-hvga-vlx_defconfig 
make menuconfig           #following the feature setting changes below
mv .config ./arch/arm/configs/<platform_defconfig>  #e.g. sp8810ea-vlx_defconfig or sp8810ea-hvga-vlx_defconfig 
make mrproper

//Android 4.3 (API level 18) and higher:
or in project folder
source build/envsetup
lunch xxx
kdconfig
kmconfig

The platform_defconfig is one of the configuration files located in either the arch/arm/configs directory of the kernel or a vendor-provided configuration file, 
e.g., sp8810ea-vlx_defconfig. At the make menuconfig step, enable the following required configurations. Depending on the kernel version, 
the location of these configuration settings in menuconfig might be different:

•General Setup -> Profiling Support
•Kernel hacking -> Tracers -> Trace process context switches and events #####default is off

if Tracers enabled, will add these configs
+CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS=y
+CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y
+CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
+CONFIG_NOP_TRACER=y
+CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING=y
+CONFIG_EVENT_POWER_TRACING_DEPRECATED=y
+CONFIG_CONTEXT_SWITCH_TRACER=y
+CONFIG_TRACING=y
+CONFIG_FTRACE=y
+CONFIG_ENABLE_DEFAULT_TRACERS=y
+CONFIG_BRANCH_PROFILE_NONE=y
+CONFIG_BINARY_PRINTF=y

#if need kernel debug symbols, do the following setting:
•Kernel hacking -> Kernel debugging
•Kernel hacking -> Compile the kernel with debug info

•Kernel Features -> High Resolution Timer Support
#•Kernel Features -> Use local timer interrupts (only required for SMP)


The context switches and events option is not visible if other tracers configurations are enabled. 
Having other tracers configurations enabled is sufficient to turn on context switches and events.

Optional kernel configurations, for some Cortex-A8 targets:

#•System Type -> SoC_name debugging peripherals (enable core performance counters on supported SoCs)

After configure, do a clean build for B2G as the following:

cd ..
rm -rf out
rm -rf objdir-gecko
./build.sh

*DS-5 tool installation*
{{{

From P:\PLD\APPS\B2G\DS5, copy DS500-BN-00001-r5p0-11rel0.tgz to ~/DS-5, and decompress it, you got install.sh, make if executable if not. and install the tool following the installation steps
}}}
*Building the Gator Module*
{{{

From P:\PLD\APPS\B2G\DS5, copy DS500-PA-00001-r5p0-11rel0.tgz to ~/DS-5/gator

To create the gator.ko module,

#(full path is required)
export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/apusr/B2G/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-   
export ARCH=arm
cd ~/DS-5/gator/driver-src
tar xzf gator-driver.tar.gz
cd gator-driver
make -C <KERNEL_BUILD_DIR> M=`pwd` modules	
Where <KERNEL_BUILD_DIR> is the B2G kernel build directory, e.g. B2G/out/target/product/sp8810ea/obj/KERNEL, a full path is required.

If this builds successfully, a new gator.ko module now resides in gator-driver.

To create the hrtimer module,

cd ~/DS-5/gator/hrtimer_module
make -C <KERNEL_BUILD_DIR> M=`pwd` modules	
Where <KERNEL_BUILD_DIR> is the B2G kernel build directory, e.g. B2G/out/target/product/sp8810ea/obj/KERNEL, a full path is required.

If this builds successfully, a new hrtimer_module.ko module now resides in hrtimer_module.

To Create gator daemon, 

You have to have android build environment

you can use the attached gatord
}}}
*Running Gator*
{{{

Load the kernel onto the target and copy gatord and gator.ko into the file system of the target. gatord for Linux is located in /ds-5 install dir/arm/gator/linux. 
gatord for Android is located in /ds-5 install dir/arm/gator/android. Enter the following command to ensure gatord has execute permissions:

or
copy gator-daemon to your android project, mm

chmod +x gatord

gator.ko must be located in the same directory as gatord on the target. With root privileges, run the daemon

sudo ./gatord &	

You can also use the attached script file inst.sh to simplify the procedure.
}}}
*Launching DS-5*
{{{
If you choose to put an DS-5 icon into ubuntu desktop, you can launch it directly from there, or you can start from Applications->Programming->Eclipse for DS-5.
}}}
*DS-5 license server setup*
{{{
If you run DS-5 for the first time, you have to set up its license server. Goto help->ARM License Manager, choose Add license, select License Server, Host: 10.0.0.236 Port: 7010, and click Add
}}}
*Using ARM Sreamline Data View*
{{{

Much of the functionality of ARM Streamline requires the Streamline Data view. To open the
Streamline Data view:
1. Select Window → Show View → Other...
2. Expand the ARM Streamline group.
3. Select Streamline Data.

Start Capture

Starts a capture session. Streamline uses your settings from the Capture Options
dialog box. If you have not defined settings using the Capture Options dialog box,
Streamline connects to the target at the address that you entered in the Address
field using default values for each of the capture options. Once pressed, a dialog
box appears that prompts you to enter a title for the Capture.

Ref to the link for more detailed user guide.
}}}
*Note*
{{{

ARM Streamline first time connection errors are frequently related to target network setup or the interference of firewalls with port forwarding. 
If you are certain these are not causing a problem, it might mean your Board Support Package (BSP) provider has not installed the gator driver and daemon required by Streamline. 
If you do not have a ready-made BSP with Streamline installed, then you must download the Linux kernel sources, and build the BSP.
